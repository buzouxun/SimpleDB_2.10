CS4432 - Project 1

Students: Junyu Zhu & Tianyu Li

Emails: jzhu1@wpi.edu & tli@wpi.edu

Installation:
There is no specific installation instructions. We have our JUnit testing files which will be running to show the results of Task 2.1, 2.2, 2.3. 
TA can run our JUnit testing cases. All Junit tests are under test folder in ExtendedSimpleDB.zip.

Note: please run JUNit testing cases, one by one. Don't run them together. 

To save time, we really like to do a DEMO with TA when TA is available. 

If you have any questions, please contact us.
Thanks very much!
