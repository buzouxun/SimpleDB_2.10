Planner: ExploitSortQueryPlanner

Idea: the first merge-join phase will run in open() function in MergeJoinPlan.java. The sorted flag in TableInfo will be used here to decide whether need to go through the first phase. 


two table: test1 & test2. two tables have the same primary keys but in the reverse order, with the purpose to gurantee that the full functionality merge-join will be needed to run


Two Querys for mergejoin job:
SELECT a1,a2 FROM test1
SELECT b1,b2 FROM test2


Exp 1 - numRecordToInsert = 600;

time of the first join: 	86351231967	nano seconds
time of the second join: 	195832770	nano seconds


Exp 2 - numRecordToInsert = 800;

time of the first join: 	120674056196	nano seconds
time of the second join: 	622811867	nano seconds


Exp 3 - numRecordToInsert = 1000;

time of the first join: 	143124841087	nano seconds
time of the second join: 	762170968	nano seconds
